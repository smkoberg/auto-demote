Overlay top story from '/r/twosentencehorror' on top image from '/r/abandonedporn'

Take the top story from the twosentencehorror subreddit and overlay the text on the top image from the abandonedporn subreddit.

Things to take into account:
  You need your own credentials for both praw and imgur.
  File output location needs to be supplied
  Font file is not included and the path may need to be updated
 
There is a lot of work that could be done to improve upon this script. This was just a project to test interacting with Reddit, imgur, and playing with PIL
